# starynight-photography
 This is front end webiste for my wifes photography business. 
 
 To build this project I used HTML5 and to style it I used CSS3. For the design I used Flex Box and Css Grid along with other CSS styling. Images are from Pexels until I can replace them with images from my wifes work.
